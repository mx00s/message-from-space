Image
-----

This image was produced from the twelfth radio transmission using :doc:`previously contributed code <radio-transmission-recording>`.

This partly annotated version of the image was made using :ref:`code from message #3 <message3-code>`.

Interpretation
--------------

Operator 416 is consistent with checking whether the first number is strictly less than the second number. We will denote it as `lt`.

Decoded
-------

.. literalinclude:: message12-decoded.txt


Code
----

The :ref:`Haskell code <message3-code>` has been revised to decode new glyphs.

Example output:
